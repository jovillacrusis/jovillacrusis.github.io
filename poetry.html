<h1>How to Encourage Others to Write Poetry</h1>

<p>I will say it's alright<br>
There is a place for traffic rage.</p>

<p>It does not have to rhyme,<br>
To unfurl stiff hours.</p>

<p>We thought abundant to give away,<br>
Without naming it.</p>

<p>Here is pain in cursive,<br>
poetry is the promise of its loss.</p>

<p>Certain as bones stretching<br>
to fill bigger spaces.</p>

<p>The hollow cathedrals of our craniums,<br>
filled with man-made hymns.</p>

<p>This world declared relevant,<br>
why not this hobby?</p>

<p>Be it a bullet point above,<br>
knitting and watercolours.</p>

<p>WHEN YOU WRITE<br>
it is a remnant of the old pain</p>

<p>Speaking, each beat aligns somewhere.<br>
A flap of unspecified wings</p>

<p>A language<br>
That does not belong to any age.</p>

<p>An animal<br>
that has no concept of a cage.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h1>Into The Middle of Things</h1>

<p>The poetry that moves me <br>
inconveniences the banal coupling <br>
of reason and aesthetic, <br>
into the middle it adamantly arrives<br>
premature of its birth.</p>

<p>Should it be given form,<br>
its approximate might be some entity<br>
as shocking as a nylon clad albino<br>
seated on flowered chintz<br> 
sipping blood from dainty china.</p>

<p>Its voice a terrible grace,<br>
and its silence<br>
equal only to the quiet<br> 
of an inert bludgeon.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h1>Only Way Forward</h1>

<p>t&nbsp;&nbsp;r&nbsp;&nbsp; u&nbsp;&nbsp; t&nbsp;&nbsp; h</p>

<p>was abstract in the chuck taylor years.<br>
was absolute during the dogma years<br>
was convenient during the 9-5 years<br>
was whatever you said during the blindness<br>
you called me chicken<br>
I clucked<br>
was a tether in the year of the ambush<br> 
the easiest year--for I had none left <br>
--all the days were chores<br>
my Filipina bones sanded to form <br>
by duty and chores<br>
it was me in my mindless best</p>

<p>t&nbsp;&nbsp;r&nbsp;&nbsp; u&nbsp;&nbsp; t&nbsp;&nbsp; h</p>

<p>is the poetry of knowing<br>
the hurt is the cause of the healing <br>
in the first place</p>

<p>and without the healing <br>
you wouldn't want to be you <br>
before the hurt <br>
anyway.</p>
