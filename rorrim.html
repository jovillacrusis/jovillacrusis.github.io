<h1>The Garden</h1>

<p>"For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror, which we are still just able to endure, and we are so awed because it serenely disdains to annihilate us."</p>


<p>-Rainer Maria Rilke</p>





<h2>Rorrim</h2>

<p>She did not remember how she came to be here. She knew she did not belong, that much she knew. She remembered waking up to see people hovering above her, they were suffused with light, that was the only concrete memory that explained how she came to be here, the wordless here as she liked to call this place. This place was strange, this certainty came from the memory of another place, the before place an older, different version of her calls it Earth.</p>


<p>Still the wordless here is home. She wished she could use words as proficiently as she was able to, back on Earth, where there were words and pencils and papers (which goes with coffees and cigarettes, the very correlation confuses her now), everything named in its proper place. This place defies the very word: proper, if the proper place is approximately translated here it would be called: "the known place."</p>


<p>How can one describe the indescribable? She could say, well I start my day here like thisâ€¦ but she cannot, because there are no concept of days or hours or time for that matter. There is sleep but it divides nothing, no boundaries to distinguish day or night. There is still the luminaries out there, as constant as their ebb and flow, but the inhabitants do not recognize the authority of the sun and the moon and their significance to life being lived or any present activities. Sleep was done when it was needed, no set schedule, no collective rule. Sometimes her activities are strenuous than previous ones already completed, and so she rests and sleeps accordingly after.</p>


<p>What are the activities here? She remembers the dogmatic practicality of thinking back on Earth, the priority of matters of importance. So she should describe first the most basic activity which is food procurement. The word food is not apt to describe the act of nourishment, there is no solid form to ingest, no act of chewing, biting, peeling, cutting, plates or forks and spoons. One simply must go to stations, hook one's arm to a tube and nourishment flows to the blood stream. Complete in all the nutrients and vitamins needed to ensure good health. Water can be had anywhere it is flowing. Feeling like a tour-guide to an audience, she walked to the middle of the plaza where a kind sculpture made of stone cupping its hands where water flowed, she drank from its cupped hands even if she was not thirsty just to explain, you can drink anywhere there is water.</p>


<p>Secondly, she smiled to herself..secondly, old habits do not completely fade she mused. Here, there is no secondly because there is no firstly. Numbers do not exist here to count things, nothing is owned, nothing needs to be accounted for, there is no use for numbers. No land to measure, land is land, it is there, no need to measure or explain what it is for. The same goes for the form that carries her, this body. It is a vessel that contains her, it has no measurement or weight. Scientifically it does, what is called "mass", but the significance of measuring and weighting no longer exists. She remembered she thought of the word secondly to relay the second "matter of importance" which is what is called back on Earth as "work". The closest she could describe work here is the co-mingling of the words: duty, curiosity, fun, wholeness, happiness, fulfillment. If there is a word to merge all those said and the hidden implication of its inherent certainty to each of the inhabitants, as exact as DNA, each one knows what they are here for. Generally they all strive perfection, to evolve. Particularly they all search, whatever that entails. Hers, is connecting the mystery of her memories of Earth and of the wordless here.</p>



<p>ii. Hedgehog's Dilemma</p>


<p>She approached a hunched figure clearly in pain. She was the first one to see him, otherwise others would have gathered around him to offer comfort. What happened? she asked. I jumped from the top of yon roof and twisted my ankle, he said. She gathered him close to her arms. She wondered if there were others near the area, close enough for her to send out thought energies and summon help. She tried anyway, she felt his answering gratitude to this.</p>

<p>Why did you jump?</p>

<p>I wanted to test how much weight the impact could take versus the height of the building.</p>

<p>She smiled at this. You like the feeling of falling.</p>

<p>Yes, that too...what is it you thought of just now? It was something significant, I felt it.</p>

<p>Yes, it is very significant to something I have been trying to figure out. There are memories you see, of another place and I remembered the people in that place. How they live together for so long and still be apart from each other. If you and I were both there right now in the same situation. I would have hesitated helping you, I would have put myself above your pain and there would be so many conditions I ask myself first before helping you, it will not be inherent that I do.</p>

<p>This place does it still exist?</p>

<p>I am not sure. Perhaps no longer. They, we, lacked the capacity to think further than the given moment we were in. They were not able to summon kindness even to save themselves. Right now I am helping partly out of kindness, but also because we are one and we understand the irrefutable logic of that. Anything that benefits you will one day benefit me too, for you are striving to perfect yourself, so am I. One day perhaps you will be instrumental to complete the missing piece that made my life incomplete as yet. I do not know this as a fact so I am covering all bases. Plus, it feels good to feel needed.</p>

<p>Perhaps that one day is now.</p>

<p>She smiled at him suffused with love. They were walking slowly to a nourishment station. A girl approached them with a water flask, he took it and touched the girl's hand in thanks. They continued on, but he stopped when they reached a pond. They sat down by the edge of a pond and he submerged his swollen ankle, letting the water cool the hot pain.</p>

<p>Tell me more about this place, he said.</p>

<p>People talk to each other differently there. They veil the real meaning of words. They use uneeded words too, and they use words at circumstances when the opposite of it is needed.</p>

<p>How so?</p>

<p>Right now for example, it would have been appropriate first that I say something about the weather, since I have just met you. It would be odd talking to you with this level of familiarity already.</p>

<p>But we do not want to talk about the weather, we have questions that needs to be answered?</p>

<p>There are norms to be followed, in order to get to the bottom of things. It is like a labyrinth, you have to go through first before you get to the essence.</p>

<p>Is it not more logical one goes directly to the root or essence?</p>

<p>Yes it is, but intentional pain inflicters exists in that place. One cannot ascertain who they are unless one follows these rules and rituals. It is dangerous to trust so easily. It will cost you your light, or pain and even the taking of your life.</p>

<p>These are very primitive life forms then. Such system does not assure continuity.</p>

<p>Yes. Still there are exceptions. There are some who are evolved enough to surpass the limitations of their habitat. When you see and meet them, you will be deeply moved. It is like seeing a lovely blossom grow amidst the marsh.</p>

<p>He stood up and offered his hand to her. He wept a little and she understood. He was breathing in the gift of the wordless here because there is now the comparison of another place so polar to where he existed. He also realized that entropy could also decay the wordless here and could change it to that other place. What ensures the state they exist in is this great love that envelops them. The perfect synthesis of it. Like the planet is a pulsing, beating place with a vein being fed by the vitality inside them. This that animates them and lives behind the orbs of their eyes.</p>

<p>She stayed with him even after he was nourished and carried to the healing place to have his ankle treated. She is uncertain if she will ever see him again but that is irrelevant as he now occupy a permanent dwelling in her memories.</p>



<p>iii. Brocken Spectre </p>


<p>She saw the dancing shadow as she sylphed through the trees. It span the whole of the valley, this graceful ghost swaying atop trees only finally from chest up: projected solidly at the opposite mountain wall. </p>

<p>For a while she admired its random soft movements. There was no beat or repetition to the spectre's dance. She looked back at the direction of the sun and started her trek. Up towards the top of the mountain where the moving shadow originated from. Her hike was brisk and intent on catching the elusive form that so fascinated her everytime she walked in these parts. Some days dreamily sitting on soft peat watching this airy incarnation until drowsy she slept.</p>

<p>She met a little girl emerging from a cave made from the bark of a magnificent giant tree. </p>

<p>"You must feel so happy seeing it always," she said.</p>

<p>The girl stared up at the mountain spectre and cheerfully nodded. "It's a graceful force that pushes me back to the present, how can you not look?" </p>

<p>"Is that why you painted eyes in all of the trees?"</p>

<p>"This is what I do, I have finished two mountains, I'm on to the next forest."</p>

<p>"Why is this so important?"</p>

<p>"We seek ourselves in another being to grant it our kindness, we have not learned yet that living beings do not necessarily need to look like us for us to treat them as our own. We are kin to every life source."</p>

<p>The girl had leaves painted all over her body where her clothes did not cover. She stood up and swayed like the mountain ghost, stripped off her clothes and faded into the forest.</p>
